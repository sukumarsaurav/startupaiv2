                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Service Workers:</strong> JavaScript files that act as programmable proxies between web applications and the network, enabling offline functionality.</li>
                                <li><strong>Web App Manifest:</strong> A JSON file that provides information about the web application, allowing it to be installed on home screens.</li>
                                <li><strong>HTTPS:</strong> Secure connections are required for many PWA features, particularly service workers.</li>
                                <li><strong>Responsive Design:</strong> Ensuring the application works seamlessly across different screen sizes and devices.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>PWAs represent a significant evolution in web development, providing users with faster, more reliable, and more engaging experiences while allowing developers to build and maintain a single codebase that works across multiple platforms.</p>

                                <li><strong>App Store Presence:</strong> Being listed in app stores provides visibility and discovery opportunities that PWAs must achieve through other marketing channels.</li>
                                <li><strong>Background Processing:</strong> Native apps have more robust capabilities for background processing, though PWAs' background sync and periodic sync features are evolving.</li>
                                <li><strong>Platform Integration:</strong> Native apps can integrate more deeply with platform-specific features and design guidelines.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h4>When to Choose PWAs:</h4>
                            <p>PWAs are particularly well-suited for:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Content-focused applications where information access is the primary goal</li>
                                <li>E-commerce and retail applications</li>
                                <li>Media and news applications</li>
                                <li>Business tools and productivity applications</li>
