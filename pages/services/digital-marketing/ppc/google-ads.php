                        <p>Google Ads budgets vary based on industry, competition, and goals. We recommend starting with a minimum of $1,000/month for most businesses to generate meaningful data and results. We'll help you determine the optimal budget based on your specific goals, industry benchmarks, and competitive landscape. Our approach focuses on maximizing return on ad spend rather than just spending a fixed budget.</p>

                        <p>Google Ads can generate traffic immediately after launch, with initial performance data available within the first few days. However, campaign optimization typically takes 2-4 weeks as we gather sufficient data to make informed adjustments. Meaningful business results usually develop within 1-3 months as we refine targeting, messaging, and landing pages based on performance data. Throughout this process, we provide regular updates and transparent reporting on campaign progress.</p>

                        <h3>What's the difference between Search and Display ads?</h3>
                        <div class="toggle-btn"><span class="icon"></span></div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Search ads appear when someone actively searches for keywords related to your business on Google. They're text-based and target users with high purchase intent who are specifically looking for your products or services. Display ads are visual banners that appear on websites within Google's Display Network. They're ideal for building brand awareness, remarketing to previous visitors, and reaching potential customers earlier in their buying journey. Most comprehensive Google Ads strategies incorporate both formats for maximum effectiveness.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>We typically recommend a minimum 3-month commitment to allow sufficient time for campaign optimization and to generate meaningful results. However, we don't lock clients into long-term contracts. After the initial period, we operate on a month-to-month basis where our continued partnership is based on the value and results we deliver. We're confident in our ability to demonstrate clear ROI, which is why we don't rely on contracts to retain clients.</p>
